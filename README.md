## Getting Started
This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting this project locally. Clone this repo and then perform the following steps. 

### Prerequisites
1: Clone the repo

2: I wrote this assignment in a Windows development environment. To run the code, open your CMD and navigate to the current working directory (i.e., the directory in which this README file is stored). Then, you can run the following script to activate the Python virtual environment:
```sh
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Once the virtual environment is activated, you should be able to open and run Assignment.py.
